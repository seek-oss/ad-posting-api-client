# SEEK's Job Ad Posting API Client

## What It Is
1. A .NET version of SEEK's Job Ad Posting API Client which can be installed via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SEEK.AdPostingApi.Client).
2. It comprises of the following three projects:
    1. *SEEK.AdPostingApi.Client* - Source code of the API client
    2. *SEEK.AdPostingApi.SampleConsumer* - Example code using the API client to make requests to the Job Ad Posting API
    3. *SEEK.AdPostingApi.Client.Tests* - Contract (PACT) tests between the API client and the Job Ad Posting API.

## What It Does
1. Exchanges the OAuth 2.0 credentials (client key and client secret) for an OAuth 2.0 access token.
2. Using the OAuth 2.0 access token:
    1. Retrieves the API links from the Job Ad Posting API.
    2. Depending on the operation (create, update, retrieve or expire):
        1. Builds the appropriate API link for the operation.
        2. Makes the appropriate request to the API.

## Usage

### Install the API Client
Via NuGet with `Install-Package SEEK.AdPostingApi.Client`

### Initializing the API Client
To initialize a client, the following values are needed:
* **Client Key** [Required]: the client key for getting an OAuth 2 access token
* **Client Secret** [Required]: the client secret for getting an OAuth 2 access token
* **Environment** [Optional]: the environment to which your consumer will integrate with, either "Integration" or "Production" can be supplied. Without supplying anything, "Production" will be used by default.
* **AdPostingApiBaseUrl** [Optional]: the URL of the Job Ad Posting API. Without supplying anything, the Production URL will be used by default.

### Example Code: Construct an API Client to Create a Job Advertisement

```c#
IAdPostingApiClient postingClient = new AdPostingApiClient("<client id>", "<client secret>", Environment.Integration);

var ad = new Advertisement
{
    CreationId = "Sample Consumer 20151001 114732 1234567",
    ThirdParties = new ThirdParties { AdvertiserId = "Advertiser Id" },
    JobTitle = "A Job Title",
    JobSummary = "Job summary of the job ad",
    AdvertisementDetails = "Experience Required",
    AdvertisementType = AdvertisementType.Classic,
    WorkType = WorkType.Casual,
    Salary = new Salary
    {
        Type = SalaryType.HourlyRate,
        Minimum = 20,
        Maximum = 24
    },
    Location = new Location
    {
        Id = "Melbourne",
        AreaId = "MelbourneNorthernSuburbs"
    },
    SubclassificationId = "AerospaceEngineering"
};

AdvertisementResource advertisement = await postingClient.CreateAdvertisementAsync(ad);
```

### Example Code: Custom Request Logging

This client supports specifying a custom [DelegatingHandler](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.delegatinghandler?view=netstandard-1.5) for logging or processing requests/responses before they're sent. The custom delegating handlers will:

 1. Be last in the request pipeline before sending the request; and
 2. Will have the `InnerHandler` automatically set by the `AdPostingApiClient`

For example, a custom `LoggingDelegatingHandler` can be specified:

```c#

public class LoggingDelegatingHandler : DelegatingHandler
{
    protected override async Task<HttpResponseMessage> SendAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        Log.Verbose("Making request to {RequestUri}", request.RequestUri);
        return await base.SendAsync(request, cancellationToken);
    }
}

using (var client = new AdPostingApiClient("<client id>", "<client secret>", Environment.Integration, new LoggingDelegateHandler()))
{
    // Use the client as per normal
}
```

## Building

The build scripts are written in [Cake](https://cakebuild.net) (C#), and will automatically pull down the required .NET Core SDK.

### Prerequisites

  1. Powershell v4 or later
  2. [CS-Script](https://github.com/filipw/dotnet-script) for generating PACT markdown files.
     _If ".Net Core 2.1 Global Tool" does not work, use the OS-specific install instructions._

### Steps

Run the builds from the `build` folder.

Some example targets:

 * `.\build.ps1 -Target Help` to list help
 * `.\build.ps1 -Target Test` to build and run all tests
 * `.\build.ps1 -Target Test -Configuration Debug` to build and run all tests in debug mode
 * `.\build.ps1 -Target NuGet` to build a NuGet package in `/out`
 * `.\build.ps1 -Target PactMarkdown` to generate Markdown of the PACTs in `/pact`, this is required if they've changed
 * `.\build.ps1 -Target UploadPact` to build, run all tests, and upload the PACTs to the broker
    * The broker can be specified with environment variables: `PACT_BROKER_URL`, `PACT_BROKER_USERNAME` (optional), and `PACT_BROKER_PASSWORD` (optional)

### Notes

 * The latest PACTs should be committed to `/pact`, this includes the documentation generated with the `PactMarkdown` target
